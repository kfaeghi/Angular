# Definition of Done

>The **definition of done** is exactly what you think: a list of criteria that has to be met before any work can be considered **done**. _Failure to meet any one of these conditions means the work is not complete_.

## Definition of Done
We will keep adding detail and examples to this as we gain understanding of any ambiguities that come up.

For clarity, a task/pull request will not be considered to be complete until all these items can be checked off.  
**Feature/User Story**  
* [ ] Task has its own **GitHub issue** (something it is solving)
  * [ ] **Estimate of expected time** required to complete task was agreed with all present and recorded **before starting the task**
  * [ ] Issue number is **included in the commit messages** for traceability
* [ ] **Record actual time taken** for the task in the PR
* [ ] Acceptance criteria are met 
* [ ] **Update the README.md** with any changes/additions made  
* [ ] **Functional tests passed**
* [ ] **Code builds with no error**
* [ ] **Meets compliance requirements**
* [ ] ** Documentation is updated **  


* [ ] Descriptive pull requests, answering:
  + What problem/issue are you fixing?
  + What does this PR implement and how?


* [ ] **Assign a person** for a code review
  + This person _will be contacted **first**_ if a bug is introduced into `master`
